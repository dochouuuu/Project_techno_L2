# net-a46

## Description

This project is a **single-player puzzle game** inspired by *Net* from **Simon Tatham’s Portable Puzzle Collection**.

The objective of the game is to connect the pieces of a grid to form a coherent network, where each piece must be correctly oriented to establish connections with adjacent pieces.

This branch corresponds to the **initial draft / baseline version** of the project.  
It contains the **very first files created from scratch**, mainly focused on:
- defining the core interfaces,
- setting up the build system,
- writing **test functions** to validate basic behavior.

This branch serves as a **reference snapshot** of the early project state and allows recovery if later development introduces breaking changes.
